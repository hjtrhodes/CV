## Harry Rhodes

As an aspiring tech professional with a background as a primary teacher and year group leader, I bring a unique blend of creative, analytical and interpersonal skills as well as a passionate growth mindset to the world of technology. 

After taking time to expose myself to basic programming in HTML, CSS and Python I realised how much I enjoyed the challenge of solving coding problems and mastering new ideas. As a result I made the exciting decision to pursue a career in Tech and enrolled on the Makers Software Development bootcamp. I have since been pleased to discover that abilities honed in my previous career, such as simplifying and breaking down concepts, collaborating with a team to pursue a shared goal and my desire to learn, have served me well when mastering the new technologies, programming languages, and development tools I have been exposed to. 

In my new career I am looking for an opportunity to add value to a collaborative and innovative environment. I am excited to progress my skills by deepening my current knowledge base and challenging myself to learn even more new technologies.

## Work Experience

**Crosfields School / Head of Year 3 - (September 2022 - March 2023)**
**Britannia Village Primary School / Year 5 and 6 Leader - (September 2014 - August 2022)**  
- For 8 years I worked in diverse educational environments, effectively managing relationships and collaborating with a range of stakeholders, demonstrating my adaptability and teamwork both in person and remotely. My teams always performed effectively and maintained positive relationships.
- I aimed to maximise the use of technology in the classroom, I gained a Google Level 2 Educator certification and leveraged Google Education software in the majority of my lessons, this consistently boosted engagement with lesson content and produced more technologically literate pupils, particularly during the pandemic.
- I used Scratch to introduce fundamental coding concepts, demonstrating a clear ability to communicate complex ideas in a simplified manner, pupils used this to create their own simplistic programs.
- I contributed to and often led a culture of continuous improvement among teaching colleagues by providing and receiving feedback with a consistently positive attitude, this improved joint professional performance.
Through thorough planning and organisation, I delivered engaging lesson content tailored to diverse learning needs.
- I challenged the makeup of curriculum units and redesigned them. This allowed me to display my creativity and desire for innovation and led to improvement in curriculum engagement and educational standards.
- I regularly communicated with parents, exhibiting resilience and efficiency and always maintaining positive relationships when liaising on pupil progress, behaviour and handling challenging conversations and conflicts.
- I regularly acted as a mentor for new teachers and PGCE students, empowering and guiding them towards effective teaching methods and collectively improving our pedagogy.
- I studied part time for my Masters Degree in Education, this involved rigorous research, analytical thinking and a commitment to continuous learning which is now serving me well in my Makers journey!
