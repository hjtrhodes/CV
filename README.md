## Harry Rhodes

As an aspiring tech professional with a background as a primary teacher and year group leader, I bring a unique blend of creative, analytical and interpersonal skills as well as a passionate growth mindset to the world of technology. 

After taking time to expose myself to basic programming in HTML, CSS and Python I realised how much I enjoyed the challenge of solving coding problems and mastering new ideas. As a result I made the exciting decision to pursue a career in Tech and enrolled on the Makers Software Development bootcamp. I have since been pleased to discover that abilities honed in my previous career, such as simplifying and breaking down concepts, collaborating with a team to pursue a shared goal and my desire to learn, have served me well when mastering the new technologies, programming languages, and development tools I have been exposed to. 

In my new career I am looking for an opportunity to add value to a collaborative and innovative environment. I am excited to progress my skills by deepening my current knowledge base and challenging myself to learn even more new technologies.

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
